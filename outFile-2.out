          We travel light. Let’s hunt some Orc.
Yes! Ha!

CONTINUED:
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI disappear into the WOODS, following
the URUK-HAI trail.
EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP - DAY
FRODO and SAM scramble onto a high ridge.
WIDE ON: A distant line of SAW TOOTHED mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains
... MORDOR!
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look with grim determination.
                       FRODO
          Mordor! I hope the others find a safer
road.
SAM (simply)
          Strider’ll look after them.
                       FRODO
          I don't suppose we'll ever see them

          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.
ARAGORN pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it on.
                       ARAGORN
          Leave all that can be spared behind.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... a steely light in his eye.
                     ARAGORN (CONT’D)
